so this is how the system works
first when opening the system it will display "Get Your Number Here" then click anywhre to slide the page and proceed to the 2nd page
2nd page will show an option [Mayors Working Permit] and [Mayors Clearance] then after selecting another option will opne 
3rd option [Newly Hired] and [Renew] when the user click the [Newly Hired] option another page with show
Newly hired option clicked - will show or display a forms liek name, address and Branngay to be fill up by the user. after bthe user have filled up the form the print number button will be clickable and the number will be printed





after printing the page will redirect to the main page.

now the problem was, when call next the color of the next number wont be seen becasue it is trhe same color as trhe employee display background.

also at the stats part, when I only click done was only one client adn at the stst all the client that get a number will be all go t the stst number

it should be like this
sample
there is 5 client
the 5 clients get a number
then the employee will call the first number
1 client was mark as done - zt the stats it will only update 1 
next the employee will call next number
2nd client will be mark as no show -  at the stats it wont be added it will remain the count to one
3rd client nwas mark as done - it will be update the ststs, updae tyotal client 2
4th client mark as done - it will be update the ststs, updae tyotal client 3
5th client mark as no show - it wont be update the stats updated total cluent 3


the color of the next number was not visible at the employee display because the etxt of the calliing numbers were also red
